 As a Presidential Ambassador, I often host Trustees when they are on campus. 
 This past week, I attended a dinner with the Board of Trustees at President Lori 
 White's house. The first hour of the evening was spent mingling and discussing
 events from the day of meetings. At dinner, I shared more about myself and the
 campus experiences I hope to draw on as a student representative. Conversation points
 included my perspective on non-Greek student housing and time in the computer science
 department.
